      <p>
        Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
        bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the
        book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in
        it, `and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice `without pictures or
        conversation?'
      </p>
      <p>
        So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
        hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of
        making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
        picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
        close by her.
